Webpack plugins for reporting new builds to your dashboard and uploading source maps for deobfuscating stack traces.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev webpack-bugsnag-plugins
```

## Plugins

### `new BugsnagBuildReporterPlugin(build, opts):`[`WebpackPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/)

```js
const { BugsnagBuildReporterPlugin } = require('webpack-bugsnag-plugins')
```

Reports your application's build to BugSnag. It can auto detect source control from `.git`, `.hg` and `package.json`. This plugin hooks into the `'after-emit'` event once all output files have been generated by the Webpack compiler. If anything causes the compilation to fail before this step, the build report will not get sent.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/build-integrations/webpack/#reporting-builds) for further details.

---

### `new BugsnagSourceMapUploaderPlugin(opts):`[`WebpackPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/)

```js
const { BugsnagSourceMapUploaderPlugin } = require('webpack-bugsnag-plugins')
```

Upload your application's sourcemap(s) to Bugsnag. When Webpack is done producing output, this plugin detects sourcemaps for any output chunks and uploads them to Bugsnag.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/build-integrations/webpack/#uploading-source-maps) for further details.
